# Core
1. Always create a TODO list for every task and proceed with modifications and additions step by step.
2. Write clean code without comments.
3. Maintain consistent code conventions.
4. Consider responsiveness and work with a mobile-first approach.
5. Make sure to remove debug code and any code that failed during the modification/addition process.6
6. Fundamentally, you should modularize thoroughly from the very beginning. The more you break it down, the easier it will be to modify later.

## UI
1. Always adopt a mobile-first approach for the UI to ensure responsiveness.
2. In doing so, apply generous padding and margins, and avoid spacing UI components too tightly.
3. The size and alignment of icons must remain consistent.
4. Since excessive use of 3D icons can clutter the design, it is generally recommended to use Font Awesome.
5. Prioritize a compact design above all else.
6. NEVER Use gradation.
